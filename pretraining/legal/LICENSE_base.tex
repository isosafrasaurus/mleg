\subsection{Likeness Data} means any and all data that constitutes an embodiment or representation of the Volunteer's Likeness. For the purposes of this Agreement, ``Likeness'' means the Volunteer's physical character, which includes, but is not limited to, the Volunteer's (i) visual appearance, including photographic, video, and other visual representations of their face and body; and (ii) other distinctive personal attributes, characteristics, or indicia that serve to physically identify the Volunteer. Likeness Data may be derived from (a) data of the types specified by Volunteer in Appendix A attached hereto (the ``Volunteer-Specified Data Types''), which Volunteer may, at their discretion, elect to provide to Developers; and (b) any images, recordings, and data embodying the Volunteer's Likeness that are publicly accessible, which the Developers may independently obtain.
  
\subsection{Platform} means the \textit{machine learning-enabled granularity} (MLEG) software, including all related, associated, integrated, derivative, or ancillary software, applications, tools, libraries, modules, components, updates, upgrades, enhancements, documentation, and any other software developed, operated, maintained, or provided by Developers, whether currently existing or hereafter created, that directly or indirectly supports, enhances, or interacts with the MLEG software, or that is otherwise used by Developers in connection with the provision of services under this Agreement.
  
\subsection{Purpose} means the goals of training and testing the Platform to generate consistent character imagery, as intended by Developers and expressly acknowledged by Volunteer, and to demonstrate the Platform's capabilities in formal academic settings. For the purposes of this Agreement, ``formal academic settings" are defined as: (i) presentations or demonstrations at accredited universities, colleges, or research institutions; (ii) presentations at academic conferences, symposia, or workshops; or (iii) publications in peer-reviewed academic journals or conference proceedings. Any use of Likeness Data beyond this defined Purpose, including but not limited to commercial applications or public demonstrations outside of formal academic settings, is strictly prohibited without explicit written consent from the Volunteer.

\subsection{Term} means the effective duration of this Agreement, commencing on the Date first written above and continuing until terminated in accordance with Article 6 herein.

\subsection{Data Specification}
Volunteer shall be entitled to specify the types of data that represent their Likeness in Appendix A attached hereto. Such data may include, without limitation, photographs, videos, textual annotations, metadata, and any other form of relevant information. Volunteer acknowledges there is no obligation to provide data of these specified types to Developers, and Developers are authorized to independently acquire Likeness Data from publicly available sources.
  
\subsection{License Grant}
Volunteer hereby grants to Developers, for the Term and solely for the Purpose, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to utilize, process, modify, adapt, analyze, and reproduce Likeness Data--regardless of its origin--for the Purpose. This license is strictly limited to the Purpose and does not confer any additional rights on Developers.
  
\subsection{Reservation of Intellectual Property Rights}
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a transfer of ownership of any intellectual property rights inherent in the Likeness embodied within the Likeness Data from Volunteer to Developers. Volunteer retains all rights, title, and interest in and to their Likeness.

\section{Volunteer Rights and Controls}
\subsection{Data Specification Control}
Volunteer retains the right to specify and modify the Volunteer-Specified Data Types detailed in Appendix A, subject to reasonable limitations and upon providing written notice to Developers of any modifications.
  
\subsection{Consent for Use Beyond Purpose}
Any use of Likeness Data by Developers that exceeds the explicitly defined Purpose shall require express, specific, and fully informed written consent from Volunteer, which may be granted or withheld at Volunteer's sole discretion. No consent shall be implied.
  
\subsection{Data Review Rights}
Volunteer has the right, upon reasonable prior written notice to Developers, to request a summary of the sources of Likeness Data used by Developers and to discuss compliance with this Agreement.
  
\subsection{Right to Withdraw Data Use Consent}
Volunteer reserves the right to withdraw consent for any future use of Likeness Data at any time, for any or no reason. Upon receiving such notice, Developers must cease further use of Likeness Data acquired after the notice and comply with the data destruction obligations in Section 6.2. For publicly available Likeness Data acquired prior to the notice, Developers must make commercially reasonable efforts to stop its use pursuant to the Purpose within a reasonable timeframe.
  
\subsection{Confidentiality of Volunteer-Provided Data}
Developers shall keep any Volunteer-provided Likeness Data strictly confidential and shall not disclose or distribute it to any third party without Volunteer's express prior written consent, except as required by law (in which case prompt notice shall be given to Volunteer).

\section{Developers' Obligations and Restrictions}
\subsection{Limited Use}
Developers' use of Likeness Data is strictly limited to the Purpose. Use for any other purpose, including commercialization or product development beyond the Platform, is prohibited.
  
\subsection{Data Security Measures}
Developers shall implement and maintain commercially reasonable security measures to protect Likeness Data and Volunteer-provided data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
  
\subsection{Transparency and Reporting Obligations}
Upon a reasonable request from Volunteer, Developers shall provide a comprehensive report detailing how Likeness Data has been sourced and used to train the Platform.
  
\subsection{Restrictions on Derivative Works}
Developers are prohibited from creating derivative works based on, incorporating, or utilizing Likeness Data except as strictly necessary for training the Platform. Any outputs or generated content from the Platform using Likeness Data are not considered derivative works but remain subject to all restrictions in this Agreement. Developers may not use Likeness Data to test, train, or demonstrate any other machine learning model or technology without obtaining separate written consent from Volunteer.
  
\subsection{Prohibition on Sub-licensing or Transfer}
The limited license granted under Section 2.2 is personal to the Developers and may not be sub-licensed, assigned, or transferred to any third party without Volunteer's express prior written consent.
