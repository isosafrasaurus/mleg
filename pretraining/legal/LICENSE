1. DEFINITIONS

1.1. Likeness Data means any and all data that constitutes an embodiment or
representation of the Volunteer's Likeness. For the purposes of this Agreement,
"Likeness'' means the Volunteer's physical character, which includes, but is not
limited to, the Volunteer's (i) visual appearance, including photographic,
video, and other visual representations of their face and body; and (ii) other
distinctive personal attributes, characteristics, or indicia that serve to
physically identify the Volunteer. Likeness Data may be derived from (a) data of
the types specified by Volunteer in Appendix A attached hereto (the "Volunteer-
Specified Data Types''), which Volunteer may, at their discretion, elect to
provide to Developers; and (b) any images, recordings, and data embodying the
Volunteer's Likeness that are publicly accessible, which the Developers may
independently obtain.

1.2. Platform means the machine learning-enabled granularity (MLEG) software,
including all related, associated, integrated, derivative, or ancillary
software, applications, tools, libraries, modules, components, updates,
upgrades, enhancements, documentation, and any other software developed,
operated, maintained, or provided by Developers, whether currently existing or
hereafter created, that directly or indirectly supports, enhances, or interacts
with the MLEG software, or that is otherwise used by Developers in connection
with the provision of services under this Agreement.

1.3. Purpose means the goals of training and testing the Platform to generate
consistent character imagery, as intended by Developers and expressly
acknowledged by Volunteer, and to demonstrate the Platform's capabilities in
formal academic settings. For the purposes of this Agreement, "formal academic
settings" are defined as: (i) presentations or demonstrations at accredited
universities, colleges, or research institutions; (ii) presentations at academic
conferences, symposia, or workshops; or (iii) publications in peer-reviewed
academic journals or conference proceedings. Any use of Likeness Data beyond
this defined Purpose, including but not limited to commercial applications or
public demonstrations outside of formal academic settings, is strictly
prohibited without explicit written consent from the Volunteer.

1.4. Term means the effective duration of this Agreement, commencing on the Date
first written above and continuing until terminated in accordance with Article 6
herein.

form of relevant information. Volunteer acknowledges there is no obligation to
provide data of these specified types to Developers, and Developers are
authorized to independently acquire Likeness Data from publicly available
sources.

2.2. License Grant
Volunteer hereby grants to Developers, for the Term and solely for the Purpose,
a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to utilize,
process, modify, adapt, analyze, and reproduce Likeness Data--regardless of its
origin--for the Purpose. This license is strictly limited to the Purpose and
does not confer any additional rights on Developers.

2.3. Reservation of Intellectual Property Rights
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a transfer of ownership of any
intellectual property rights inherent in the Likeness embodied within the
Likeness Data from Volunteer to Developers. Volunteer retains all rights, title,
and interest in and to their Likeness.

Data at any time, for any or no reason. Upon receiving such notice, Developers

obtaining separate written consent from Volunteer.
